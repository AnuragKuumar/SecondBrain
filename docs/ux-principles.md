# UX Principles

## The Five Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
Every interaction has obvious intent. No hidden features.

### 2. Hierarchy Through Space, Not Color
Use whitespace and typography for structure. Color is accent only.

### 3. Motion Guides Attention
Animation directs focus and provides feedback. Never decorative.

### 4. Intelligence Should Feel Invisible
AI enhances workflow without demanding attention. Auto-save, suggestions, not interruptions.

### 5. Progressive Disclosure
Show essentials first. Reveal complexity on demand.

## Visual Language

**Colors**
- Background: #FAFAFA (calm)
- Surface: #FFFFFF (clean)
- Accent: #3B82F6 (actions)
- Text: #171717 / #737373 (hierarchy)

**Typography**
- System fonts for performance
- 14px body, 18px subhead, 32px title
- Line height 1.6 for readability

**Motion**
- 200-300ms transitions
- Ease-out curves
- Purposeful, not flashy
